<h2>Summary</h2>
<div  class="mormaltext" >The digital website of Matrícula de Tributos aims to make more readers aware of the provinces of the Aztec Empire and their tributes. We ported the physical version of the codex to the display and brought an explanation of its contents. This website is created and operated by <a href="https://weibo.com/u/7594804434"target="_blank" >@阿兹特克帝国驻华使馆</a> <a href="https://weibo.com/u/7594804434"target="_blank" >(@Aztec Empire Embassy in China)</a>. This is a non-profit amateur history institution. </div>

<h2>Content</h2>
<div  class="mormaltext" >The content of each pages on is based on the <a href="http://www.mesolore.org/"target="_blank" >Mesolore</a>. It is authorized to quote. Mesolore has been created by Liza Bakewell and Byron Hamann.</div>
<div  class="mormaltext" >Dr. Liza Bakewell received her PhD in anthropology at Brown University in 1991, after which she joined the faculty at Brown, where she has remained, first teaching in the Department of Anthropology, later conducting research and directing The Mesolore Project at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Her research areas include linguistics, women studies, art, and aesthetics, all of which appear in her most recent book, Madre: Perilous Journeys with a Spanish Noun (W.W. Norton, 2011). Bakewell has received awards from the National Science Foundation, Ford Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, the Davis Educational Foundation, and the Fulbright Program.</div>
<div  class="mormaltext" >Dr. Byron Hamann received a dual PhD from the departments of Anthropology and History at the University of Chicago in 2011. His research centers on prehispanic Mesoamerica, early modern Iberia, and the connections linking the Americas and Europe in the early modern transatlantic world. He is coauthor of the CD-ROM Mesolore: Exploring Mesoamerican Culture, and project manager for the DVD-web resource Vistas: Visual Culture in Spanish America 1520-1820. </div>

<h2>Map</h2>
<div  class="mormaltext" >The map we created is based on the book Aztec Imperial Strategies. This book is a comprehensive analysis of the economic and political geography of the Aztec empire. It is the fruit of a joint research project among ethnohistorians, archaeologists, and art historians that originated as a Summer Seminar at the Dumbarton Oaks research center in Washington, DC. The authors researched every town in the Aztec empire, recording a set of standard information for each. They drew a new map of the empire by first plotting local towns and city-states and then grouping these by province. This map, the first complete map of Aztec territory since Robert Barlow's 1949 study, reveals new principles of provincial organization. Aztec Imperial Strategies presents a new interpretation of the expansion and organization of the Aztec empire. The most complete and comprehensive study ever undertaken of the empire, this book breaks new ground by providing new models for Aztec imperialism. We drew this map using the Mapbox map tool. Michael E. Smith and Frances F. Berdan helped us a lot during our map creation.</div>
